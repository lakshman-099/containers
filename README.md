# My Docker Learning Journey 🐳

Welcome to my Docker learning repository! 🚀

## Introduction

This repository is a part of my journey into the world of Docker and containers. As I dive into the fascinating realm of containerization, I've created a simple Flask web app and transformed it into a Docker container.

## What I've Done

- Developed a basic Flask web app.
- Created a Docker image of the Flask app.
- Launched the Flask app as a container using Docker.

## Docker Hub Image
You can find my containerized Flask app on Docker Hub:
